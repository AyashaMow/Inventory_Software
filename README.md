I created a Loan Module and a Service Module in the Inventory Software. 
I built all these modules using CodeIgniter 3, a PHP framework.
I set up routes, controllers, models, and views.
I fixed inventory query issues and functionality problems.
I improved the responsive design of views using Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML. I set up mysql database.
I created new reports, such as the Balance Sheet and Profit/Loss Reports, with filter options for Daily, Monthly, and Yearly reports.
I have already completed the access setup for clients.
I have a clear understanding of Inventory Software.
The system includes modules such as Customers, Suppliers, Products, Purchases, Sales, Sales Returns, Purchase Returns, Quotations, Vouchers, Salary, Users, Reports, Settings, and Access Setup.
I have set up the login page.I have configured the company profile and made many small enhancements across all modules.
